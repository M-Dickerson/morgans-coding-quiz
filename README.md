# Morgan's Quiz!

## Description

The motivation and purpose behind this project was to make a quiz that utilizes local storage, a timer, and javascript. I learned a lot about using javascript to create and append elements on the page. I also learned how to change "pages" without relying heavily on css and html.

## Usage

Link to deployed application: [Link to app](https://m-dickerson.github.io/morgans-coding-quiz/)

To play all you have to do is click the start button! The application handles the rest.
