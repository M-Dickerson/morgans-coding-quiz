# Morgan's Coding Quiz!

## Description

The motivation and purpose behind this project was to make a quiz that utilizes local storage, as well as a timer variable. I learned a lot about implementing local storage and using javascript to create and append elements on the page.

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```
